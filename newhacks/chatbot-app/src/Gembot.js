Step 1. Know the risks
Although the consequences of various disasters can be similar, knowing the risks in your region can help you better prepare. Across Canada, we face a number of hazards, such as floods in many provinces, earthquakes in British Columbia, blizzards in Nunavut and tornadoes in Ontario. In addition to natural disasters, there are other types of risks, such as power outages and industrial or transportation accidents.

Some of the risks below may be relevant to your community. Find out which ones by visiting GetPrepared.ca. You may want to identify the most likely ones for easy reference. You may also want to find out how disasters have impacted Canadians. Learn more about disasters, including those triggered by natural hazards, technological hazards or conflict by using the Canadian Disaster Database at: http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cdd

For more emergency preparedness information, visit GetPrepared.ca or follow @Get_Prepared on Twitter.

Step 2. Make a plan
Every Canadian household needs an emergency plan. It will help you and your family know what to do in case of an emergency. It will take you about 20 minutes to make your plan.

Your family may not be together when an emergency occurs. Plan how to meet or how to contact one another, and discuss what you would do in different situations.

Use the following pages to create your plan. Most of this information can be filled out on your own. You may need to get some information from your municipality and province/territory about their emergency plans. A list of provincial emergency management agencies is available at the end of this guide.

Keep this document in an easy-to-find, easy-to-remember place (for example, with your emergency kit). Photocopy this plan and keep it in your car and/or at work, and a copy close to your phone. If you completed your plan online, keep an electronic version on your computer.

Plan for specific risks
Public Safety Canada offers brochures on specific risks, such as earthquakes, power outages, floods and severe storms. Download copies from GetPrepared.ca.

Neighbourhood safety plan
Work with your neighbours to identify people who may need extra help during an emergency. To help make sure everyone is taken care of, assign “block buddies.”

Write yourself a reminder to update your emergency plan one year from now.

On this date next year, review your contact information, practise your emergency evacuation plans, change the batteries in your smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector, and restock your kit(s). Change the batteries, food and water in your emergency kits once a year.

Household plan
Emergency exits

Draw up a floor plan of your home that shows all possible exits from each room. Plan a main exit route and an alternate exit route from each room. If you live in an apartment, plan to use the stairs instead of the elevators. If you are unable to use the stairs, notify emergency personnel ahead of time. Also, identify an evacuation route from your neighbourhood in case you need to leave in a hurry (and think of more than one option).

Meeting places

Identify safe places where everyone should meet if you cannot go home or you need to evacuate.

Safe meeting place near home:

___________________________________

Safe meeting place outside immediate neighbourhood:

___________________________________

___________________________________

Evacuation routes from neighbourhood:

Safe idea
Make copies of important documents

Make copies of birth and marriage certificates, passports, licences, wills, land deeds and insurance. Take photos of family members in case a lost persons record is created. Keep them in a safe place, both inside and outside your home. You might want to put them in a safety deposit box or give them to friends and family who live out of town.

Workplace
Learn about the emergency evacuation plans in place and what you will need to do. You may want to have some basic supplies at work, such as water and food that won't spoil, in case you need to stay put for a while.

Check  with your employer about workplace emergency plans, including fire alarms, emergency exits, meeting points, and designated safety personnel or floor wardens.

Children
Ask your children's school or daycare about their emergency policies. Find out how they will contact families during an emergency.

Find out what type of authorization the school or daycare requires to release your children to a designated person if you can't pick them up.

Make sure the school or daycare has updated contact information for parents, caregivers and designated persons.

Designated person 1: ______________________ Phone: __________________

Designated person 2: ______________________ Phone: __________________

School contact information: __________________________________________

Plan for pets
In case of an evacuation, remember that pets are not allowed in some public shelters or hotels. In case of an evacuation, prepare to take your pets with you to the home of a relative or friend, or take steps to identify pet-friendly hotels or pet boarding facilities in your area and further away from home.

Location and contact information :___________________________________

Special health needs
Establish a personal support network of friends, relatives, health-care providers, co-workers and neighbours who understand your special needs.

Write down details about:

Accommodation needs
Insurance information
Allergies
Medical conditions
Emergency contacts
Medication
Family medical history
Recent vaccinations
Health screenings
Surgeries
Keep a copy of this information in your emergency kit, and give a copy to your personal support network.

Talk to your doctor about preparing a grab-and-go bag, if possible, with a two-week supply of medication and medical supplies. Include prescriptions and medical documents. Remember that pharmacies may be closed for some time, even after an emergency is over.

Safe home instructions
Make sure you have a working carbon monoxide detector, smoke alarm, fire extinguisher and well-stocked first aid kit. If you live in an apartment, or if you are staying in a hotel, know where the fire alarms and at least two emergency exits are located.

Make sure you have a fire extinguisher on every level of your home, including one in your kitchen. Everyone in your home should know where to find the fire extinguishers. All capable adults and older children should know how to use it. See instructions regarding the lifetime of your fire extinguisher and check with your local fire department for more information.

Older children and adults should know how to turn off your home's water, electricity and gas. Make large, easy-to-see signs for water and gas shut-offs as well as for the electrical panel.

Teach children how and when to dial 9-1-1 as well as how to call the designated out-of-town contact.

Limit phone calls to urgent messages only. Keep calls short to free up the lines for others.

Emergency instructions
Call 9-1-1 (where available) to report a fire, a crime or to save a life.

For non-emergency calls, use the ten-digit numbers listed in your local phone book, or this emergency plan, for police, fire and other health services.

When notifying emergency services of your location, provide the exact street or civic address and nearest intersection.

For the gas and water valves, keep shut-off instructions close by and read them carefully.

In an emergency

Follow your emergency plan.

Get your emergency kit.

Make sure you are safe before assisting others.

Listen to the radio or television for information from authorities. Local officials may advise you to stay where you are. Follow their instructions.

Stay put until all is safe or until you are ordered to evacuate.

Evacuation orders

Authorities will not ask you to leave your home unless they have reason to believe that you may be in danger.

If you are ordered to evacuate, take your emergency kit, your wallet, personal identification for each family member and copies of essential family documents with you. Bring a cellular phone and spare battery or charger with you, if you have one. Use travel routes specified by local authorities.

If you have time, call or e-mail your out-of-town contact. Tell them where you are going and when you expect to arrive. Once you are safe, let them know. Tell them if any family members have become separated.

If possible, leave a note telling others when you left and where you are. Shut off water and electricity if officials tell you to do so.

Leave natural gas service on unless officials tell you to turn it off. If you turn off the gas, the gas company has to reconnect it. In a major emergency, it could take weeks for a professional to respond.

Take pets with you. Lock your home. Follow instructions from authorities.

If you go to an evacuation centre, register your personal information at the registration desk. Do not return home until authorities advise that it is safe to do so.

Step 3. Get an emergency kit
In an emergency, you will need some basic supplies. You may need to get by without power or tap water. Be prepared to be self-sufficient for at least 72 hours.

You may have some of the items already, such as food, water and a battery-operated or crank flashlight. The key is to make sure they are organized and easy to find. Would you be able to find your flashlight in the dark?

Make sure your kit is easy to carry and everyone in the household knows where it is. Keep it in a backpack, duffle bag or suitcase with wheels, in an easy-to-reach, accessible place, such as your front-hall closet. If you have many people in your household, your emergency kit could get heavy. It's a good idea to separate some of these supplies in backpacks. That way, your kit will be more portable and each person can personalize his or her own grab-and-go emergency kit.

Basic emergency kit
Water – at least two litres of water per person per day; include small bottles that can be carried easily in case of an evacuation order
Food that won't spoil, such as canned food, energy bars and dried foods (replace food and water once a year)

	avalanche: `How to prepare before an avalanche
If you live or travel in areas that are at risk of avalanches, take steps to prepare yourself.  If you’re planning outdoor recreation activities in the backcountry, prepare with addtional resources, courses, and essential safety equipment.

Ensure you have an emergency kit for your vehicle
If you plan to recreate in the winter backcountry, learn the basics of identifying avalanche terrain
Be aware of where avalanches can form. They happen on slopes that are at least 25° steep, are at least the size of a tennis court (about 10 m X 10 m) and holding at least 30 cm of snow
Understand the weather factors that can contribute to increased avalanche hazard
Snowing 2 cm/hr for several hours
Strong winds
Sudden warming
Recognize signs that indicate avalanche hazard is elevated
Seeing shooting cracks in the snowpack around your feet
Hearing a wumpf sound from the snowpack beneath your feet
Seeing evidence of recent avalanches on nearby slopes
Check the avalanche forecasts in your area
Never travel alone in avalanche terrain
Road Safety
Most highways in Canada, exposed to avalanche terrain, have control teams that work to prevent avalanches. Occasionally throughout the winter, roads close to allow these teams to use explosives to trigger smaller, controlled avalanches. This lessens the possibility of larger, uncontrolled avalanches occurring when the highway is open.

When highway avalanche control work is occurring, barriers are erected to stop traffic. Never go past a barrier or traffic control person into a closed avalanche zone
If you are travelling through areas of Canada that are exposed to avalanche terrain, pay attention to local weather, news, and information outlets
Stay informed about any road closures planned for avalanche control work
Ensure that you have an emergency vehicle kit with you. Pack extra food, water, and blankets in case of an unexpected and extended road closure due to an avalanche or for avalanche control
Never stop your vehicle in a section of highway that has been marked as an avalanche zone
If you are stopped by an avalanche on the highway, turn around and get out of that zone before calling for help
Outdoor Recreation Safety
Avalanche Canada provides daily avalanche forecasts for popular mountainous regions throughout the winter months. If you are travelling in the backcountry, always check the avalanche forecast before going out
Never go into avalanche terrain alone
Get the training. Take an Avalanche Canada Training course to learn how to recognize avalanche terrain, trip planning, and companion rescue
Get the gear. Everyone in a backcountry group needs to carry the essential avalanche equipment—a transceiver, probe, and shovel—and know how to use it
Companion rescue training is critical. If your group is involved in an avalanche, there is no time to go for help
Research indicates there is just 10 minutes when the odds of recovering a buried victim alive is at 80%
After that 10-minute window, the chances of survival drop steeply
Safety at home
Learn about the history of and potential for avalanches in your area
Learn how to recognize signs of increased avalanche hazard, which includes sustained and significant snowfall, high winds, and/or sudden warming during the winter months
Know who to notify if you recognize these signs (e.g., municipal emergency centres and municipal engineers)`,

	hurricane: `What to do when a Hurricane Watch or Warning is issued
Hurricanes can often be predicted one or two days in advance of their landfall. The key to hurricane protection is preparation. By taking precautions before, during, and after a hurricane, lives can be saved and property damage averted.

It is important to stay informed by listening to the latest warnings and advisories on radio, television, or web sites. The Canadian Hurricane Centre will issue and update these when necessary.

If a hurricane is forecast, secure everything that might be blown around or torn loose. Flying objects such as garbage cans and lawn furniture can injure people and damage property.
Trim dead branches and cut down dead trees to reduce the danger of these falling onto your house during a storm.
Stock up on water, ready-to-eat food and heating fuel, as well as battery-powered or wind-up flashlights and radios - and extra batteries. Make sure that there is gasoline in the car. For a complete list of emergency supplies, go to emergency kits. Also, learn what to have in your car emergency kit.
If you live on the coast or in a low-lying area near the coast, be prepared to move inland and to higher ground if instructed by local officials. The high winds can create large waves at sea which may become storm surges when they reach the shore. If you are advised by officials to evacuate, do so. Take your emergency kit with you`,

	permafrost: `How to prepare for permafrost degradation
Your home may be at risk of structural problems if it is built on soils, especially those with fine materials such as silts and clays. Bedrock usually provides a stable foundation, whereas soils with silts and clays often contain a lot of ice and are vulnerable to permafrost degradation. Soils with well-drained coarser material like sands and gravels are generally less vulnerable to permafrost degradation than soils with fine materials. Wet ground and poor drainage may indicate the presence of silt or clay. A foundation that accommodates thaw, such as an adjustable foundation or piles driven deep into the ground can help reduce the effects of thawing permafrost.

Prepare your home
You can do things that reduce thaw by keeping the area under and around the building as cold as possible.

Around your home
Take actions around your home to prevent or slow the thaw of permafrost.

Keep snow cleared so it does not insulate the ground
Shade south sides of buildings
Promote airflow under buildings in winter by keeping the area under and beside buildings clear and removing snow drifts
Limit removal of natural vegetation and use mulch to reduce warming of the ground in the summer
Ensure water does not accumulate near your home by directing draining away and removing snow piles
Inspect your foundation
Inspect the foundation and interior and exterior of the build and watch for:

cracks in drywall
sticky doors and windows
cracks in foundation
settlement and heaving of buildings
floors or roof lines out of true
If you have an adjustable foundation, you can level your house as required. Help from experts may be required if there are serious issues.`,

Warning signs include:
Severe thunderstorms, with frequent thunder and lightning
An extremely dark sky, sometimes highlighted by green or yellow clouds
A rumbling sound or a whistling sound.
A funnel cloud at the rear base of a thundercloud, often behind a curtain of heavy rain or hail.
Canada's tornado warning system
Environment Canada is responsible for warning the public when conditions exist that may produce tornadoes. It does this through radio, television, newspapers, its internet site, as well as through its weather phone lines.

Early warning signs of a tsunami
One of the signs of a potential tsunami is the occurrence of a very large earthquake that lasts for more than 20 seconds. If an area has been shaken by a very large earthquake, one should be on alert that shorelines located within the radius of the earthquake's epicentre, may be hit by a tsunami.
A more immediate and ominous sign of an approaching tsunami is a rapid and unexpected recession of water levels below the expected low tide. This can occur minutes before the shoreline is struck by a tsunami and can be the only sign along coastlines that are located too far from the earthquake epicentre to have felt the shaking.
A tsunami may also occur with very little warning.
Natural Resources Canada's seismologists monitor for such events, around the clock. As soon as possible, a tsunami warning is issued to media and municipalities in regions where a tsunami is likely to hit.
The Canadian Coast Guard's Marine Communications Traffic Services broadcasts tsunami alerts to mariners.
When you get warning of a tsunami, if there is time, move to higher ground immediately.`,
